Fakeguitar
An electric guitar SFZ Library

To use, you will need a plugin capable of loading SFZ files, such as Sfizz or Sforzando (SForzando will be easier for Windows users.)
1) Load fakeguitar1.sfz or fakeguitar2.sfz into your plugin. Two exist in case you want 2 guitars playing the same part simultaneously.
2) This sample library supports 3 articulations: open picked notes, muted picked notes, and tapped notes. To switch between the articulations, simply play note 0, 1, or 2 in your midi track or on your midi keyboard.
3) If there are any questions, message u/aprildoll on reddit or send an email to aprildolly@mail.com
